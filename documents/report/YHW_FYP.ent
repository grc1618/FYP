macro:->For
example,
portfolio
manager
A.
Douglous
Rao,
who
went
to
University
of
Virginia,
appears
in
the
Morningstar
database.
However,
the
entry
in
CRSP
Survivorship
Bias
Free
database
is
recorded
as
A.
Rao.
To
ensure

I
use
the
fund
name
information
attached
to
A.
Rao
and
find
his
biography
through
online
search
and
confirms
that
this
individual
indeed
is
called
A.
Douglous
Rao
and
went
to
the
University
of
Virginia.
Thus,
I
fill
in
the
full
name
in
CRSP
Survivorship
Bias
Free
database
so
that
it
will
guarantee
a
match
with
the
